# Near-Chat

It includes a contract and a BOS component

The contract code is in [src/lib.rs](src/lib.rs), and the BOS component code is in [bos-component/Chat.jsx](bos-component/Chat.jsx).

The BOS component interacts with the contract and allows user (with a near account) to send message to the public.
